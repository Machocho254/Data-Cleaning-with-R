# Data-Cleaning-with-R
This is a fun guide for data cleaning using R

1) Definition of the Question

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She has employed my services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.


2) Metric for Success

The project will be a success when;

> a) The data has been checked for completeness, dealing with missing values

> b) All inconsistencies of the data hae been dealt with, i.e duplicates and outliers

> c) THe data is uniform

> d) Doing a univariate and bivariate analysis of the data

> e) Getting the most important variables using the Principal Component Analysis.


3) Understanding the Concept

4) Experimental Design

The project followed the following design:

> Reading and understanding the data

> Checking for missing values in the dataset

> Checking for duplicates rows and values and removing them

> Checking for outliers and dealing with them. 

> Univariate analysis

> Bivariate analysis

> Multivariate Analysis

5) Data Relevance 

The relevance of the data will be answered by the following questions

> Is the data accurate to identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads?

> Is the data sufficient?

> Is there bias in the data?

> Is the source of this data reliable?
